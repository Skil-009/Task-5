1.What is Wireshark used for?

Wireshark is a free, open-source network protocol analyzer (or packet sniffer) used to capture and interactively examine data traveling over a computer network. Its main uses are network troubleshooting, analysis, software and protocol development, and education.

2.What is a packet?

A packet is the basic unit of data that is transferred across a network. It's a formatted block of data, consisting of a header (containing control and addressing information like source and destination IP/MAC addresses) and a payload (the actual user data).

3.How to filter packets in Wireshark?

Use the Display Filter toolbar at the top. Common filters include ip.addr == 192.168.1.1 (by IP), tcp.port == 80 (by port), or http (by protocol).

4.What is the difference between TCP and UDP?

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is connection-oriented, providing reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of data. It uses a three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) to establish a connection.

UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is connectionless and unreliable. It's faster because it doesn't have the overhead of error-checking and connection setup, making it suitable for applications like video streaming, VoIP, and DNS lookups.

5.What is a DNS query packet?

A DNS (Domain Name System) query packet is typically a UDP packet (on port 53) sent from a client to a DNS server. It requests the IP address corresponding to a human-readable domain name (e.g., asking for the IP address of https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=google.com).

6.How can packet capture help in troubleshooting?

It allows an analyst to see exactly what data is being sent and received, enabling them to:

Determine if a network connection is failing (e.g., seeing only SYN packets but no SYN-ACK response).

Identify application-level errors.

Locate slow-performing network devices.

Detect unexpected or unauthorized traffic.

7.What is a protocol?

A protocol is a set of rules and conventions that govern how data is formatted, transmitted, and received between computing devices. Examples include IP, TCP, HTTP, and SMTP.

8.Can Wireshark decrypt encrypted traffic?

By default, no. Wireshark can only see the encrypted packets (like TLS/HTTPS traffic). However, it can be configured to decrypt traffic if you have the appropriate private key and the traffic uses a cipher suite that supports decryption in Wireshark.
